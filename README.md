Converting drug data into millions of dollars using SAS

This example uses SAS to tabulate statewide drug-utilization data and generate drug-rebate invoices for pharmaceutical manufacturers. The end product is a paper invoice generated using Microsoft Access to request a refund of all co-payments made for drugs dispensed to medicaid-insured patients. 

Since pharma firms have an abundance of cash on hand, they often overpay the invoiced amount, leaving the program with millions extra in rebate dollars annually (income). In the first quarter of 2016, payments for Qs 2 & 3 of 2014 have exceeded the requested amounts by about 6 million dollars. In Arizona, the biggest year we had was 2013 where firms paid out a total of 28 million dollars (about $25 million extra) and our program was able to fund new ventures that included housing and other socially-oriented projects. We even funded an enterprise-wide BI tool with this money.
